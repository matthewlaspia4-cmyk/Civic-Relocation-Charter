# Civic Relocation Charter

**Matthew Laspia**  
Civic Technologist • Whistleblower • Mutual Aid Steward  
_Repository created for public testimony, legal shielding, and sociotechnological continuity._

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository documents my protective relocation undertaken in response to coordinated coercion, reputational sabotage, and institutional obstruction. It serves as a civic ledger, a public archive, and a call to action for ethical technologists, mutual aid networks, and legal advocates.

I am withholding both my current and future location due to credible threats of preemptive detainment and systemic erasure. This is not evasion—it is strategic shielding in service of public infrastructure.
