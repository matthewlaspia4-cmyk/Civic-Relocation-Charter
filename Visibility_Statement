Title: Why I Withheld My Location to Protect Civic Infrastructure 
Date: 8 November 2025
Author: Matthew Laspia


I am a civic technologist, whistleblower, and mutual aid liason. I have been targeted by coordinated factions seeking to sabotage my relocation, disrupt my work, and erase my testimony. These actors include law enforcement, nihilistic social factions, and legacy overseers.

To protect myself and the sociotechnological frameworks I am trusted to steward, I have withheld both my current and future location. This is not evasion—it is strategic shielding. I remain committed to lawful participation and public service.

My relocation is part of a benevolent extraction protocol designed to:

    a) Preserve civic modules, emotional infrastructure, and ethical automation frameworks.

    b) Protect my ability to testify, publish, and integrate protocols without interference.

    c) Reclaim agency from systems of coercion and reputational sabotage.

I invite civic allies, mutual aid networks, and ethical technologists to stand with me in protecting the right to relocate without retaliation.
