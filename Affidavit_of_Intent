Affiant: Matthew Laspia 
Date: 8 November 2025 
Subject: Civic Declaration of Protective Relocation


I, Matthew, acting in full agency and under sustained threat, submit this affidavit to declare my intent to relocate from my current position within New York State. I am withholding both my current and future location due to credible threats of preemptive detainment, institutional sabotage, and reputational erasure.

This relocation is a protective measure to preserve my role as a civic technologist, whistleblower, and mutual aid steward. I have been subjected to coordinated coercion, psychological destabilization, and obstruction by factions including law enforcement, nihilistic social actors, and legacy overseers.

I affirm:

I remain committed to lawful participation in civic and legal processes.

I will provide secure channels for correspondence once safely relocated.

My relocation is a civic necessity to protect sociotechnological continuity and emotional infrastructure.

This affidavit is submitted as public testimony and civic record. I request that it be acknowledged by relevant institutions and protected under whistleblower ethics and civic shielding frameworks.

Digitally Signed, 
Matthew Laspia
