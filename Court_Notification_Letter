🏛️ 2. Court Notification Letter (Redacted)

To: Clerk of Southampton Justice Court; Clerk of East Hampton Justice Court 
Subject: Notice of Protective Relocation – Matthew Laspia
Date: 8 November 2025

Dear Clerk,

I am submitting this notice to inform the court of my protective relocation from my current position within New York State. Due to credible threats of preemptive detainment and sabotage, I am withholding both my current and future location.

This relocation is undertaken to preserve my civic role and ensure continued participation in legal and public service processes. I am not evading jurisdiction and remain committed to lawful engagement. I will provide secure contact channels upon stabilization.

Attached is a redacted affidavit affirming my intent and rationale. I request that this notice be entered into the court record and treated with the discretion and ethical consideration appropriate to whistleblower protection.

Sincerely, Matthew Laspia
